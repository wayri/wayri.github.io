# Imported analysis visualization (beta)

Display fast PI, thermal or other scalar result fields on the saved PCB layout. The library visualizes supplied data; it does not run, qualify or validate a solver. Producer claims (`computed` or `measured`) are not independently verified. An illustrative run is prominently labelled.

```js
const viewer = new KiCadWebView.Viewer('#board');
await viewer.load('/boards/power.kicad_pcb');
// Same-origin fetch shown; a different host must permit CORS.
const response = await fetch('/results/fast-pi.json');
if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Results unavailable');
await viewer.setAnalysis(await response.json());
viewer.setAnalysisField('voltage-drop');
// viewer.clearAnalysis(); viewer.getAnalysis();
```

The secure-context helper `KiCadWebView.analysisSourceHash(savedPCBText)` hashes the exact UTF-8 source string, preserving line endings and whitespace. Compute/export the same SHA-256 in the producing program. Mismatched results are rejected before display. Opening another source clears results, including while a hash is pending. Changing PCB to 3D pauses the overlay and returning restores it. Results apply only to PCB 2D in this beta.

Coordinates are saved KiCad PCB world coordinates in millimetres: X rightward, Y downward, with no unit conversion, origin shift, rotation or interpolation. Each sample is an axis-aligned rectangle with a constant supplied scalar value. Exporters must transform their native coordinates explicitly. Values use the field's declared units; no inference or conversion occurs. A field's optional layer must exist in the saved design and its visibility follows that layer. Omitting the layer makes it a board-wide display field. Rectangles are not clipped to copper or board outlines.

Controls include field selection, overlay visibility, opacity, fixed colour scale, pointer value readout, and run details/assumptions. Actual values remain unchanged when colours clamp at scale endpoints. Missing coverage is reported as missing; it is never zero-filled. In overlapping rectangles the last supplied cell wins for drawing/probing. Opacity applies to the composed heatmap as a group.

Limits: 8 fields, 10,000 cells total, 8 MiB JSON text, finite scalar magnitudes <= 1e9, coordinate/dimension magnitudes <= 1e6 mm, positive dimensions, unique field IDs and bounded metadata. `setAnalysis` accepts parsed objects or JSON text, copies/freezes the validated contract, and rejects malformed data. Hosts should bound network response bytes before parsing when accepting untrusted URLs. Use HTTPS/localhost for Web Crypto. Analysis data remains in browser memory; this API does not upload it.

The local `analysis.html` example uses the real owner-authorized inverter with explicitly illustrative voltage-drop, current-density and temperature fields. Its deterministic gradient demonstrates the interface only; it contains no electrical or thermal analysis. A direct SPIKE/Quick PI exporter and 3D field surfaces are future integrations, not current capabilities. Adapt an existing solver's saved field output to this schema rather than inventing results or relabelling an image as quantitative data.

Scalar readouts and scale endpoints use six significant figures for presentation; the accepted dataset retains its original values through getAnalysis().
